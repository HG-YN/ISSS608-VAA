Step-by-Step Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstep\naction\nimage\n\n\n\n\n1\nLoad the Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 csv file into Tableau Desktop.\n\n\n\n2\nTabulate Female population. We created a calculated field for female population.\nWrite a formula based on Population containing “female” word under “Sex” category to extract female population.\n\n\n\n3\nTabulate Male population. We created a calculated field for male population.\nWrite a formula based on Population containing “male” word under “Sex” category to extract male population.\n\n\n\n4\nCreate the Matrix for trellis display (3 * 3 for 9 Planning Areas).

From this chart, it’s clearly seen that the top 9 most populated planning areas are: Bedok, Tampines, Jurong West, Sengkang, Woodlands, Hougang, Yishun, Choa Chu Kang, and Puggol.\nDelete this worksheet after obtaining the planning area information.

Major Observations\nWe have selected the most populated 9 planning areas in Singapore based on SingStat data in June 2022, namely Bedok, Tampines, Jurong West, Sengkang, Woodlands, Hougang, Yishun, Choa Chu Kang, and Puggol, for visual analysis. These 9 planning areas are chosen as we can observe population pyramid shape more clearly.\nSimilarities observed among all planning areas:\n\nThe population pyramid in these 9 planning areas of Singapore exhibit a “constrictive” population pyramid shape, with a relatively narrow base and a wide middle portion. There are lower number of young people (<19) compared to middle-aged people, implying a low fertility rate in general.\nThere is a broad shape at top, showing a high life expectancy in Singapore, with a high proportion of elderly population(>70). There is a higher number of female elderly population compared to male elderly population across all planning groups, indicating that usually female has a longer life expectancy.\nMale and female population are similar across all planning areas, indicating a good gender equality.\nThese most populated planning areas all fall under Outside Central Region and are residential areas. The low residential accommodation price, and abundance of residential properties may lead to high population in these areas.\n\n\nDifferences observed among planning areas:\n\nThere is a narrowing base observed in Bedok, Jurong West, Woodlands, Hougang and Choa Chu Kang. This indicates a falling birth rate in these planning areas. Whereas in the other 4 planning areas, there are more population under 0-9 age group, indicating that the birth rate has improved. The most significant increase in fertility is observed in Punggol.\nThere are differences in bulges observed in different planning areas. For example, there are significant bulges observed in Punggol and Sengkang area for population under age group 30 to 49. This could be due to residents relocation to Punggol and Sengkang for work purpose. While Bulges for Bedok are observed in 50 to 69 age group population. This may suggest that Bedok is good for retirement.\nThere are differences in indents observed in different planning areas. For example, there are significant indents observed in Woodlands for 30 to 49 age group population. This could be due to relocation of residents. While indents for Punggol happens significantly for 20 to 29 age group population."
