# Getting Started

## Install and launching R packages

The code chunk below uses p_load() of pacman package to check if tidyverse packages are installed. If they are, they will be launched into R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## Importing the data

```{r}
exam_data <- read.csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

# Plotting a simple bar chart

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam_data,
       aes(x = RACE)) +
  geom_bar()
```
